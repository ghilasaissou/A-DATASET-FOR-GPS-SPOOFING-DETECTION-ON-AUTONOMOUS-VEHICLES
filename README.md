### Abstract
A dataset of Global Positioning System (GPS) spoofing attacks is presented in this article. This dataset includes data extracted 
from authentic GPS signals collected from different locationsto emulate a moving and a static autonomous vehicle using a universal
software radio peripheral unit configured as a GPS receiver. During the data collection, 13 features are extracted from eight-parallel 
channels at different receiver stages (i.e., acquisition, tracking, and navigation decoding). In addition to the collected authentic GPS 
signals, three GPS spoofing attack types were simulated, simplistic, intermediate, and sophisticated attacks. The resultant dataset 
contains a total of 158,170 samples, including 55% of legitimate instances and 45% of samples corresponding to three types of 
simulated GPS spoofing attacks, all in a balanced distribution. The data described and attached to this article can be used to 
investigate the effect of the GPS spoofing attack on the extracted features and contribute to the development of GPS spoofing attack 
detection techniques based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning.

### Value of the Data
- The raw dataset is collected using real-time feature extraction from authentic GPS signals using a USRP unit configured as 
an eight-channel GPS receiver emulating a real GPS receiver in an autonomous vehicle. The dataset includes the correlator's 
amplitude at the time the Doppler shift is updated.
- Using the collected GPS signals, three spoofing attack types were simulated: simplistic, intermediate, and sophisticated 
attacks. A simulation was chosen over real live GPS spoofing attacks since they are illegal and risky, and setting up an indoor 
test bench was dismissed as its results are often biased and incorrect.
- The dataset is made easy for robust training of supervised/unsupervised machine learning algorithms to detect GPS spoofing 
attacks by converting the 3D cubic data from the eight parallel channels into a 2D feature map.
- The three different attacks and legitimate signals can easily be separated from each other using the label field. In this way, 
the dataset can be rearranged for binary classification with one attack at a time.
- The dataset is available in Excel format and can be converted to a comma-separated file format to help researchers easily 
import the dataset into different research software platforms and programs.
- A separate Excel file containing the raw (original) GPS data is included for researchers to use to simulate customized GPSrelated attacks or for other uses.
- As civilian GPS transmissions are open and unencrypted, GPS spoofing attacks against GPS receivers are frequent and 
dangerous. Researchers can utilize this dataset to study how different extracted features impact Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
based models' ability to identify and categorize spoofed and real instances. The research based on this dataset will then help 
the community develop robust countermeasures for GPS spoofing attacks.

### Data Description 
 
#### 1.1. Data Collection
The data was collected using a GPS receiver in two different scenarios. The first is a driving test at speeds ranging from 0 to 60 mph 
with an average speed of 45 mph. The second scenario consists of three stationary positions at different altitudes. It is worth 
mentioning that the vertical GPS position error is larger than the horizontal plane since a sufficient satellite spread is only possible 
for a horizontal plane [1].
